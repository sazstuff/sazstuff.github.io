[{"body":"Welcome! My friends call me Saz.\nI have been an IT Professional for over 25 years, a Business Owner for over 20 years, and a Licensed Electrician (specializing in low voltage systems) for about 15 years.\nFor the past year or so, I have been promising myself I would create my own website and I finally got around to putting one together about a week ago.\nThe reason I have created this site is to have a centralized place where I can document the stuff I have learned along the way as well as new stuff I am learning now. My primary audience is, well, Me... but I welcome you to come along for the ride!\nPosts on this site will range from quick snippets to full blown posts with video.\nHere is a list of stuff that interests me (in no particular order):\nNetwork Cabling Physical Access Control Video Surveillance VoIP Phone Systems Computer Hardware Operating Systems Hyperconverged Systems Firewalls Switches Storage Backups Virtualization Cybersecurity Cloud Collaboration Website Development Software Development Home Automation Electronics Projects Woodworking DIY Tools Gaming ","link":"https://sazstuff.com/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://sazstuff.com/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://sazstuff.com/archives/","section":"archives","tags":null,"title":"Archives"},{"body":"\r","link":"https://sazstuff.com/archives/map/","section":"archives","tags":null,"title":"Using OpenStreetMap"},{"body":"The \u0026quot;Notices\u0026quot; shortcode enables you to call out pieces of information - sidebars, warnings, tips, etc.\nTo create a notice on a page, you can use the notice shortcode.\nYou use the notice shortcode, with the first parameter being one of note, info, tip, and warning. Then add a title for your note in quotes as the second parameter. The inner body of the note can be whatever markdown you want to create.\nThe following shortcode syntax within a markdown doc:\n1{{% notice note \u0026#34;Note\u0026#34; %}} 2This is a standard \u0026#34;note\u0026#34; style. 3{{% /notice %}} will render as:\nNote This is a standard \u0026quot;note\u0026quot; style.\nThe other three variants follow.\nInfo Here is the \u0026quot;info\u0026quot; style.\nTip Here is a \u0026quot;tip\u0026quot; variant of a notice.\nWarning Here is the \u0026quot;warning\u0026quot; flavor of a notice.\nAlso note that the content of a notice can contain anything you could put on a normal page - as shown below:\nComplex Notices are Possible! This is a notice that has a lot of various kinds of content in it.\nHere is a bulleted list With more than one bullet And even more than one level Code blocks are fine here, too....\n1public void SayHello() 2{ 3 Console.WriteLine(\u0026#34;Hello, world!\u0026#34;); 4} Productivity Booster!

Because it has alt text but no title text, the caption is generated by the alt text.\nRemote image, specified caption The following image is loaded from a remote URL. The alt text is the same (for screen readers and in cases when the image doesn't load) but because a separate title is provided, the title is used for the caption:\nThis is Jane Doe Image with alt text and no caption Alt text is always recommended for SEO, accessibility and in cases when images don't load. However, you don't necessarily always want an image to have a caption. In that case, use a title with one space:\nBlockquotes The blockquote element represents content that is quoted from another source, optionally with a citation which must be within a footer or cite element, and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations.\nBlockquote without attribution Tiam, ad mint andaepu dandae nostion secatur sequo quae.
